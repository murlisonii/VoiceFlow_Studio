# **App Name**: VoiceFlow Studio

## Core Features:

- Speech-to-Text Conversion: Convert speech input from the user into text using an STT engine like Whisper.
- LLM Agent Integration: Pass the transcribed text to a pluggable LLM agent. The agent processes the text and generates a response.
- Text-to-Speech Conversion: Convert the LLM agent's response back into natural speech using a TTS engine.
- Modular Pipeline Design: Implement a modular pipeline (STT -> LLM -> TTS) that allows businesses to plug in their own custom LLM agent without re-engineering the entire system.
- Real-Time Interaction: Ensure real-time or near real-time interaction by optimizing latency for small exchanges.
- Domain-Specific Example 1: Customer Service: The LLM tool incorporates a knowledge base of common support inquiries.
- API and SDK Provision: The system should generate simple APIs and SDK documentation for external developers.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm blue (#64B5F6) evoking trust and reliability.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#E3F2FD) providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A contrasting yellow (#FFEB3B) to highlight interactive elements and important information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, neutral feel suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent different functionalities and settings within the voice agent studio.
- A clean, intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the process of configuring their voice agents.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and enhance the user experience without being distracting.
